# Nadjia.JS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/forject/Nadjia.JS.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/forject/Nadjia.JS)
Nadjia is aimed to make the deployement of your projects as easy as possible. Nadjia hooks up to a specific branch of your repository and executes the deployement for you, if something is pushed into that branch. 

## Why use Nadjia.JS
Nadjia.JS will soon be able to launch .sh/.js scripts. This gives you the following opportunity:
- Write your deployement-scripts in Node.JS or Bash
- Push them to your repository
- Add them to your Nadjia.json
- Install Nadjia.JS on your server and set the Repository
- Off you go! Deployement should work like a charm now :)

## Getting started

Install needed dependencies
`` npm install ``

Start up Nadjia.JS Server
`` node nadjia.js ``
