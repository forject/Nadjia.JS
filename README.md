# Nadjia.JS
Nadjia is aimed to make the deployement of your projects as easy as possible. Nadjia hooks up to a specific branch of your repository and executes the deployement for you, if something is pushed into that branch. 

## Why use Nadjia.JS
Nadjia.JS will soon be able to launch .sh/.js scripts. This gives you the following opportunity:
1. Write your deployement-scripts in Node.JS or Bash
2. Push them to your repository
3. Add them to your Nadjia.json
4. Install Nadjia.JS on your server and set the Repository
5. Off you go! Deployement should work like a charm now :)

## Getting started
Wanna get started? Damn! Nadjia is not far enough yet. Stay tuned! We will update this soon.
